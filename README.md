# Youth-Futures - ANNOUNCEMENTS

CS3750

milestone #1	documentation of the project	sept 11


milestone #2	will have the code sent to us

Sabree, Juan and I (Robb) have uploaded a C# program. Take a look at it and get a little familiar with it so you can be up to speed. You will find out that it is easier than Java. There are tons of similarities so if you have any questions let any of us know. FYI, you need Visual Studio on your Mac prior to opening the file. Just fetch origin on your GitHub Desktop App and get it on your local machine (your Mac).

Brad, if you want to add any other examples for Sabree to get familiar with on C# then feel free to make changes.
